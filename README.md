# MithaiWala (website name, mithai is sweet in english, basically a sweet shop website was built)
In this repository I made my website with my friends Ritik and Yusuf And hosted it by the github pages.

This website was made for the "Design Hack" event conducted by IEEE Student Branch, Z.H.C.E.T., A.M.U.
